# KuboMod

The first fully custom NPC Mod.
Â 
The mod adds my character, Kubo, to the Battlesphere Lobby.
He stands where Pommy usually hangs around.

Featuring dialogue that respects the current game state and story flags.
Uses a custom AssetBundle loaded at runtime, to set up a fully custom NPC.

It also moves Pommy out of the way, but in return i have granted him ability to walk around.
The mod also adds few friend cameos to the trains in Shenlin Park.
